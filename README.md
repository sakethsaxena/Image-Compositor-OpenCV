The Image Compositor is an easy to use collage creator application developed using OpenFrameworks

I have added intuitive mouse and keyboard controls very similar to image manipulation applications. 
___________________________________________________________

In order to use the application, 
  Download the source files
  Initialize a new openframeworks application in Visual studio or Xcode
  Replace the existing files with the files in the source code
